#  Reflection

Personally, I did not have any expectations for this industry visit, yet that was an example of my immaturity.
This visit unexpectedly opened my eyes to the inner workings of an organization. 
Every aspect of the organisation is carefully design and inspected to increase the quality of the outcome.
This included the office setup, department arrangement and the organization's values.
I was also astounded to learn during the interview that a degree does not necessarily portray a successful career.
I acknowledge my shortcoming and have made the decision to heed any professional or experienced counsel for my future.
