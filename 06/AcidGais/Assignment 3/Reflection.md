# Reflection

I became aware that I still have a lot of room for improvement as a person and as a student after watching the speak. 
The speaker's observations emphasized the significance of constantly advancing and adjusting to the rapidly changing field of computer science. 
This insight has inspired me to actively work on improving my current abilities and picking up new ones.
I am sure I can accomplish my objectives and be successful in the field of computer science if I make a commitment to lifelong learning and development. 
I'm resolved to take full advantage of the transforming time that the following four years will provide.
