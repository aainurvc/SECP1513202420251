# REFLECTION

Throughout the assignment, I actually concern about our teamwork especially since this is our **first group project** in UTM. 
In the beginning, the project was not progressing as expected since no one want to the initiative to lead the project which is understandable.
Then, we decided to **divide the work** so that it is easier for us to focus on the project.
We also **monitor** each other work so that everything was correct and align with the instruction.
Fortunately, everything ended well. This project made us **closer** and **strengthen our bond** to work in a team.
