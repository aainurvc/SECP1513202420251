# AKRAM ALI MURSHED ALSHAMI'S WORKSPACE Welcome to My e-portfolio 

Hi. I'm AKRAM ALI MURSHED AL-SHAMI  (A23CS4022) I'm a first year Software Engineering student at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).  Here, I’ve shared my work, including assignments and a project, from my Technology and Information Systems(SECP1513)course in my first year of university. Each one includes what I learned, challenges I faced, and more. Let’s take a look!

| 1  | PC Assemble                                        | This PC Assembly activity is really interesting for me as I never had the chance to do it elsewhere. I had the opportunity to observe and learn how to assemble and reassemble a PC. The process involved opening the PC case, unplugging the cable, power supply, RAM, HDD and CPU fan. Then, we reassembled all the components and tested the computer. To be a versatile computer science student, I believe it is important to have knowledge of hardware component of a computer, not just good in software development such as coding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2  | Assignment 1 (Industry Talk Poster (AIRASIA )      | The AirAsia Industrial Talk helped me understand more about careers in technology, especially as a software engineer. I learned that gaining experience, working on projects, and sharing them online can help when applying for jobs. The talk also showed that having a diverse team brings new ideas and that challenges help us improve. This session made me more interested in technology, encouraged me to build my skills, and gave me useful career advice for the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3  | Assignment 2 (Industrial Visit to UTM Digital)     | During the industrial visit to UTM Digital, I had the opportunity to explore various workspaces and understand the diverse roles within the industry. I observed that each role demanded a specific type of workspace tailored to its requirements. The insights into server maintenance and the stringent security measures in place were particularly fascinating. Moreover, I gained hands-on experience in video editing and learned to incorporate voiceovers. check out our video: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/16e-4s8oS3m-T83Bf8ghRgzRGtLzlEAS2/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16e-4s8oS3m-T83Bf8ghRgzRGtLzlEAS2/view?usp=drivesdk)                                                                                                  |
| 4  | Assignment 3 (Academic Writing)                    | For this assignment, we were tasked with writing an academic piece based on Industrial Talk 2. Listening to the experiences of a former UTM graduate was truly motivating. It provided me with a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the industry. Hearing about their obstacles, successes, and career progress inspired me to stay focused and work diligently toward my goals. The talk also highlighted the significance of both technical and soft skills, including coding, critical thinking, and teamwork. The IRPA job application strategy was particularly insightful. This session encouraged me to participate in more tech-related activities, keep refining my skills, and seek guidance from those with industry experience. |
| 5  | Assignment 4 (Poster on bioinformatics workshop  ) | Attending the Bioinformatics Unbound workshop introduced me to bioinformatics and its applications. I learned how computational tools, AI, and machine learning solve biological problems. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) was especially interesting as it is transforming genetics and medicine. I also discovered that bioinformatics skills are useful in healthcare, business, and finance. This session sparked my curiosity and encouraged me to explore how technology advances these fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 6  | Design Thinking Project                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
