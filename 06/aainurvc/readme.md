|   1  |                               |    This was our first group activity for the semester, and I was a bit nervous at first because I feared I might break something inside the CPU. However, the task of reassembling and assembling the computer components turned out to be a great learning experience. We decided to divide the tasks evenly, which helped everything run smoothly. At the end, we needed to turn the CPU on to make sure we had assembled it correctly â€” and we did! It was such a rewarding moment. Working together in a team and successfully completing the assembly not only boosted my confidence but also taught me the importance of clear communication and cooperation in technical tasks. It was interesting and fun to see everything come together.                         |
