|PC Assemble     |Assembling a PC is an enriching and hands-on experience that taught me alot about the role each component. I understand how each part of the PCsuch as the CPU, motherboard and RAM works together to ensure its effectiveness. I learned the importance of keeping attention to details as this can affect the PC from running and caused errors. Patience and problem-solving skills were achieved as our PC were unable to run thus we figured out the problem shortly after without any complications.            |
