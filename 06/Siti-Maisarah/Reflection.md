|PC Assemble     |Assembling a PC is an enriching and hands-on experience that taught me alot about the role each component.
I understand how each part of the PC such as the CPU, motherboard and RAM works together to ensure its effectiveness
I learned the importance of keeping attention to details as this can affect the PC from running and caused errors.
Patience and problem-solving skills were achieved as our PC were unable to run thus we figured out the problem shortly after without any complications.            |
