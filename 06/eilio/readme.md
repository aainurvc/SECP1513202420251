# Hello and welcome my friend to my e-Portfolio!

My name is Abdelrahman Elfatih Abdelrahman (A23CS4032), and this is my e-portfolio where you can find my assignments and assessments of TIS (SECP1513). 

This subject has been a fun experience from building PCs to making videos of my team's proposal. It was an exciting journey

## Assesment reflection!

|PC Assemble               |I've always wondered how a PC is built and how the parts are organized inside a computer but I never got the chance to build or look inside one, but in this subject, I got the chance to do so and I am pleased I did so, I even assembled the PC the fastest! It was super fun. |
|Assignment 1 (Industry Talk Poster)             |The industry talk was really interesting, AirAsia gave us a very amazing talk and taught us how ICT and CS help them and other multi-national companies scale beyond imagination, I also learned how communication is a very important skill, especially in big companies, it helps them bridge the cultural and operational challenges and helps them build a strong and understanding community. |
