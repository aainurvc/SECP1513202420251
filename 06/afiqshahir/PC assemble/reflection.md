# PC ASSEMBLE 

This is a great experience for me to learn about the components of a PC. I've learned about how to deassamble and reassamble a PC.
I've also learned about the names of the main components of the PC, how to handle them and the functions of each one.
I believe this is a very beneficial activity to be conducted in class because its very interesting and its making it easier to remember the elements of the class as it is a very interactive experience.
