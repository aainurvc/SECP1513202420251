# project proposal

This project gave some insight on how to handle a real project. We made a project about AR technology to provide navigation throughout the faculty of computing of UTM. During this project we were exposed and made understood more about AR technology and how it works. We also learned how to alter it to match our system.
So we were very enlightened a lot on a variety of topics not just on AR technology but also project management and development.
