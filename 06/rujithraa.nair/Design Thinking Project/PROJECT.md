| We devised an innovative plan to assist the staff at Cafe Ar Rayyan in managing overloaded orders and enhancing customer satisfaction.
Our strategy involves real-time order tracking, analyzing order history to highlight popular dishes, and simplifying the menu by removing less popular items.
Additionally, we're developing a user-friendly mobile interface that offers the latest promotions, updates, and order capabilities for both staff and customers. |
