|I attended an insightful talk on entrepreneurship and an overview of working life. During the talk, I jotted down useful tips for starting a business independently. As part of the project, I was assigned to write a report on the key points discussed. This task not only provided me with valuable knowledge but also helped enhance my writing and listening skills.                                         |
