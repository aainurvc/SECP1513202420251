|1|PC Assemble                     |Building a PC was a hands-on learning experience that boosted my confidence with hardware. Though I faced challenges like motherboard alignment and boot issues, troubleshooting them made the process even more rewarding. It was a great way to apply my knowledge and sharpen my problem-solving skills.|
|2|Assignment 1                    |The talk provided valuable insights into the significance and impact of SAP in today's world. SAP enables organizations to integrate their data into a unified system, streamlining operations, reducing manual efforts, and allowing employees to focus on strategic planning. Additionally, the insights gained from SAP help businesses identify weaknesses and enhance efficiency. This underscores the crucial role of SAP in ensuring seamless and effective production. The speakers from EY Consulting highlighted the importance of a growth-oriented mindset for fresh graduates and employees, as adaptability and continuous learning are essential in the evolving ICT landscape. Curiosity drives individuals to stay updated on emerging technologies like cloud solutions and blockchain, equipping them with the knowledge to shape the future. Therefore, prioritizing both personal and professional development is key to remaining relevant and valuable in the ICT industry.|
|3|Assignment 2                    |Our visit to UTM Digital was a great experience that gave us a behind-the-scenes look at how they enhance the universityâ€™s digital experience. They welcomed us with a seminar, explaining their role and ongoing efforts to improve IT services and system management. Touring their offices and seeing their teams in action made me appreciate the hard work that goes into maintaining a smooth digital environment at UTM. Recording the visit helped us reflect on everything we learned, making it a truly insightful and engaging experience.|
|4|Assignment 3                    |Inspired by Mr. Mohd Hakimi Iqmall and Mr. Nik Mohd Habibullah, I will spend the next four yearssucceeding in computer science building on their great lessons. Mr. Hakimi builds a strong foundation for me todevelop problem-solving and critical thinking skills through logic-based understanding of computers ratherthan memory-based study of programming languages. As technology and programming environments change, Ican continue to bring forth new methods and applications within the field. Meanwhile, Mr. Nik's whole journeythrows light on the need for adaptability, self-awareness, and effective communication. He also emphasizedlearning and planning continuously and sharpening team and leadership skills. These principles willsignificantly apply through internships, participating in group projects, and being updated on advances in suchareas whose focus is cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. Such seamless weaving of technicalexpertise with soft skills, together with resilience and strategic goal setting, shall prepare me for excellence, notjust academically but also in significant contributions to the IT industry in the years to come.|
|5|Assignment 4                    |Working on this assignment was a great learning experience as it deepened my understanding of Flutter and its impact on app development. I found it fascinating how Flutter simplifies cross-platform development by allowing developers to use a single codebase for Android, iOS, web, and desktop applications. The hot reload feature, customizable widgets, and high-performance rendering engine make it an excellent choice, especially for beginners.

Researching real-world applications, such as Google Ads and Reflectly, helped me see how widely Flutter is used in the industry. However, I also learned about its challenges, such as the larger app size and the need for additional native code in some cases. Despite these limitations, it is clear that Flutter has a promising future with continuous improvements and growing community support.

Overall, this assignment helped me appreciate the importance of choosing the right development framework and how technology is evolving to make app development more efficient. It has also motivated me to explore Flutter further and possibly use it in future projects.|
|6|Design Thinking Project         |Working on the Safe Link Checker was a really interesting experience. We explored how to design a simple, user-friendly system to detect malicious links, focusing on how it would function rather than actually building it. Brainstorming ideas and sketching the interface helped us understand the challenges of cybersecurity and how to make solutions more accessible. Creating the demo video also strengthened our teamwork and communication skills, making this project both enjoyable and insightful.|
