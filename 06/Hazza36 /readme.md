|1|PC Assemble                     |Assembling a PC was such a rewarding experience—it felt like bringing something to life with my own hands. Picking out the parts was exciting, but actually putting them together was where the real challenge began. Carefully installing the CPU, fitting the RAM into place, and connecting all the cables took patience and attention to detail. There were a few frustrating moments, like figuring out why it wouldn’t boot at first, but solving those problems made it even more satisfying. The best part? Pressing the power button and seeing everything light up, knowing I had built it myself. This experience gave me a real sense of accomplishment and a deeper appreciation for how technology works.|

Engaging with the staff through interviews and discussions helped me understand their diverse roles and contributions in maintaining and improving UTMDigital’s quality. Additionally, working on the assignment fostered teamwork among our group, allowing us to collaborate effectively while improving our video editing skills. The visit, combined with the hands-on experience of documenting it, gave us a deeper appreciation of the effort behind UTM’s digital infrastructure, making it both an insightful and enriching experience.|
|4|Assignment 3                    |Inspired by Mr. Mohd Hakimi Iqmall and Mr. Nik Mohd Habibullah, I will spend the next four yearssucceeding in computer science building on their great lessons. Mr. Hakimi builds a strong foundation for me todevelop problem-solving and critical thinking skills through logic-based understanding of computers ratherthan memory-based study of programming languages. As technology and programming environments change, Ican continue to bring forth new methods and applications within the field. Meanwhile, Mr. Nik's whole journeythrows light on the need for adaptability, self-awareness, and effective communication. He also emphasizedlearning and planning continuously and sharpening team and leadership skills. These principles willsignificantly apply through internships, participating in group projects, and being updated on advances in suchareas whose focus is cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. Such seamless weaving of technicalexpertise with soft skills, together with resilience and strategic goal setting, shall prepare me for excellence, notjust academically but also in significant contributions to the IT industry in the years to come.|
|5|Assignment 4                    |Working on this assignment was a great learning experience as it deepened my understanding of Flutter and its impact on app development. I found it fascinating how Flutter simplifies cross-platform development by allowing developers to use a single codebase for Android, iOS, web, and desktop applications. The hot reload feature, customizable widgets, and high-performance rendering engine make it an excellent choice, especially for beginners.|
|6|Design Thinking Project         |This project was a transformative experience, giving me valuable insight into system development and innovation. Through extensive research on Augmented Reality (AR), we explored its applications in biotechnology education and designed a system to enhance learning. Collaborating with my team, we identified user challenges, developed a prototype, and refined our ideas based on feedback. This process strengthened my problem-solving, teamwork, and creativity. Overall, the experience deepened my understanding of AR and equipped me with essential skills for tackling real-world challenges.|
