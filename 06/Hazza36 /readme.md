|4|Assignment 3                    |Inspired by Mr. Mohd Hakimi Iqmall and Mr. Nik Mohd Habibullah, I will spend the next four yearssucceeding in computer science building on their great lessons. Mr. Hakimi builds a strong foundation for me todevelop problem-solving and critical thinking skills through logic-based understanding of computers ratherthan memory-based study of programming languages. As technology and programming environments change, Ican continue to bring forth new methods and applications within the field. Meanwhile, Mr. Nik's whole journeythrows light on the need for adaptability, self-awareness, and effective communication. He also emphasizedlearning and planning continuously and sharpening team and leadership skills. These principles willsignificantly apply through internships, participating in group projects, and being updated on advances in suchareas whose focus is cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. Such seamless weaving of technicalexpertise with soft skills, together with resilience and strategic goal setting, shall prepare me for excellence, notjust academically but also in significant contributions to the IT industry in the years to come.|

|6|Design Thinking Project         |Working on the Safe Link Checker was a really interesting experience. We explored how to design a simple, user-friendly system to detect malicious links, focusing on how it would function rather than actually building it. Brainstorming ideas and sketching the interface helped us understand the challenges of cybersecurity and how to make solutions more accessible. Creating the demo video also strengthened our teamwork and communication skills, making this project both enjoyable and insightful.|
