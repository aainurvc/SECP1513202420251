## Welcome to *SheLing's Eportfolio* !!!

#### Hi! Here is all my learning outcomes and reflections from studying *TIS* over the past few months. You're welcome to take a look!


|          **Activity**         | **Reflection**              |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
|PC Assemble               |Under the guidance of Dr. Iqbal, we learned how to disassemble and reassemble a PC, gaining a thorough understanding of its internal structure. I was deeply impressed by this activity because our team was the fastest to complete the PC reassembly. Not only did I acquire basic knowledge about PCs, but I also realized the importance of teamwork.   |      
|Assignment 1              |Before completing this assignment, we attended an industry talk about Air Asia, which gave me a preliminary understanding of and interest in the industry. During the assignment, I was responsible for designing and arranging the poster. I was delighted that the final result was well-received by my teammates.    |
|Assignment 2              |To complete this assignment, we visited UTM Digital for an industry visit. During interviews with the staff, their personal experiences were highly inspiring and solidified my career direction. Although we faced challenges with video editing, such as unclear subtitles and audio issues, we successfully resolved them with the help and cooperation of our team members.   |
|Assignment 3              |We attended a second industry talk and completed the assignment on academic writing. During the talk, I learned the IRPA Method for job applications and business applications. Due to page limitations, we encountered some difficulties in condensing the content, but we ultimately resolved these issues effectively.|
|Assignment 4              |Although we could not conduct an industry visit this time, which I deeply regretted, we participated in one of the workshops at CODE`25, titled "OSINT-Beginner’s Guide." I discovered many cybersecurity applications and their uses, which I hadn’t known before. For this assignment, I was responsible for designing and arranging the poster. The assignment went smoothly, thanks to the help of my teammates.   |
|Design Thinking Project   |This project lasted a long time. We set a theme, interviewed customers, collected data, wrote a proposal, built a model, and filmed a video. This made me realize the importance of teamwork, which significantly improved overall efficiency. I also reflected on the rapid development of technology, which allows us to unleash our imagination and bring ideas closer to reality, making the experience even more exciting.   |
