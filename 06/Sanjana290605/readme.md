|------------------|-------------------------------|
|ASSIGNMENT  1     |Assignment 1 was a group project to create a poster based on an industrial talk that was shared  using Webex recording. Every team was given a specific topic in which my team got the topic "Petronas Digital". Our teammates used the online platform Canva to create the poster together. It was a first time experience for me and my  teammates working together in an assignment.                                |                                                          
|ASSIGNMENT  2     |Assignment 2 was to create a video based on our industrial visit to UTM digital. The assignment was done in the same team as assignment 1. It was a new experience for me to  interview people. This industrial visit was a very good learning experience for us on the UTM digital located in our UTM JB campus.     |                             
|ASSIGNMENT  3     |Assignment 3 was to write academic writing. To be specific, it was a report. This report was written based on an industrial talk on the topic "Skills in  University and Industry" that was shared via a Webex recording. As it was a group project, me and teammates used the Google docs to write the report together and we also used Canva to create the cover page for our report more creatively. This assignment enables us to learn report writing skills and polish our academic writing skills.                               |                             
|ASSIGNMENT  4     |Assignment 4 was to create a poster based on our industrial visit 2. This poster was done by me and teammates based on our participation in the OSINT workshop which is the acronym for Open Source Intelligence that was conducted by PERSAKA which stands for Persatuan Mahasiswa Sains Komputer . It was a great opportunity for us to gain some knowledge on OSINT. I believe that the knowledge I gained from this workshop will come in use for my future endeavors.                               |
