## HANDS ON EXPERIENCE, ASSIGNMENTS & PROJECT


|ASSESSMENT       | COMMENT & REFLECTION |
|-----------------|----------------------|
|PC ASSEMBLE      |This was the first hands on experience for me in the Technology and system course. I was very excited to be able to detach and reattach the PC. I was able see and touch the hardware components inside the PC. This helped me to learn about hardware components which was very helpful for me to score in the quiz on the hardware components.|
|ASSIGNMENT 1 (POSTER DESIGN) file:///C:/Users/HP/Downloads/PETRONAS%20POSTER%20(1).pdf    |Assignment 1 was a group project to create a poster based on an industrial talk that was shared  using Webex recording. Every team was given a specific topic in which my team got the topic "Petronas Digital". Our teammates used the online platform Canva to create the poster together. It was a first time experience for me and my  teammates working together in an assignment.                                |                                                          
|ASSIGNMENT 2 (VIDEO)    |Assignment 2 was to create a video based on our industrial visit to UTM digital. The assignment was done in the same team as assignment 1. It was a new experience for me to  interview people. This industrial visit was a very good learning experience for us on the UTM digital located in our UTM JB campus.     |                             
|ASSIGNMENT 3 (ACADEMIC WRITING)    |Assignment 3 was to write academic writing. To be specific, it was a report. This report was written based on an industrial talk on the topic "Skills in  University and Industry" that was shared via a Webex recording. As it was a group project, me and teammates used the Google docs to write the report together and we also used Canva to create the cover page for our report more creatively. This assignment enables us to learn report writing skills and polish our academic writing skills.                               |                             
|ASSIGNMENT 4 (POSTER DESIGN)    |Assignment 4 was to create a poster based on our industrial visit 2. This poster was done by me and teammates based on our participation in the OSINT workshop which is the acronym for Open Source Intelligence that was conducted by PERSAKA which stands for Persatuan Mahasiswa Sains Komputer . It was a great opportunity for us to gain some knowledge on OSINT. I believe that the knowledge I gained from this workshop will come in use for my future endeavors.                               |                                                                                                                            
|PROJECT DESIGN THINKING PROPOSAL                 |The project design proposal was done by me and my teammates together using google docs. We decided to divide the task to make it more efficient. I was in-charge of doing the part for existing system in the project proposal. I had to compare between the existing system and the proposed system to prove the need for our new proposed system. Me and my team proposed real time bus tracking system in our campus replacing the current system which is the UTM fleet that operates based on a fixed schedule. This is because we want to reduce the uncertainty and waiting time of the passengers. It was a new experience for us to transfer our idea into a written proposal.                              |
|END PROJECT (VIDEO)                 |The end project was to create a video explaining our proposed system with a written prototype and publishing it in the Youtube.  Each and every one of our teammates were involved in recording a part of them explaining our proposed system. I explained on the need for our new proposed system by comparing it with the current system, The video from each of my teammates including myself was then combined and edited to make it more creative. Then the video was published in the youtube while link was shared in TIS whatsapp group to complete the project submission. Creating a handwritten prototype and explaining it in a video was very interesting experience that we learned from this project. It was fun to create  prototype based on our own idea.                              |
