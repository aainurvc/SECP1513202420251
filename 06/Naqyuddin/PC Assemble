# pc-assemble
hi and assalamualaikum,
Composing and decomposing a computer is a strong foundation for identifying the general operations of a PC and how it can be maintained. It teaches the practical working of hardware components, sharpens the problem/issue solving faculty and increases the understanding of computer systems. This activity was done on the 20-12- 2024 where the participant was taken through a process of building a PC from scratch and then disassemble and reconstruct it to enhance his understanding of the process. This exercise intended on taking the participants through certain hardware parts including the motherboard, central processing unit, random access memory, graphic processing unit, storage devices as well as power supply unit; in addition to making them understand how to handle and install those parts.

The PC assembly commenced by taking off the sides of a computer case in order to access the components that would be installed in the case. A small hole was made on the frontal plane of the box, and then the motherboard was fitted into it and fixed using standoffs that fit into holes in the main board and screws in order to provide a platform for other component insertions. After that the processor (CPU) was fitted into the required slot on the mother board, ensuring it has keyed with the notches then the CPU cooler with the thermal compound to allow for heat dissipation. The power supply unit for the cyclic structure was installed in its proper location and the cables were also arranged for soldering at a later time. RAM were fitted into the motherboard DIMM sockets in a such a way that the notches matched those on the RAM. Graphics cards were fitted and screwed into the PCIe slot as well as soldered to the PSU as necessary. Lastly, the hard disk drives and solid state drives were then screwed into their respective trays and *this were then plugged in to the main board using both power cables and data cables.

After successfully assembling the PC, participants disassembled and reassembled it to reinforce their understanding of the process. The reassembly required participants to identify each component, reconnect cables accurately, and ensure proper alignment and secure mounting. This step highlighted the importance of precision, patience, and component compatibility.

The PC assembly and reassembly activity was particularly beneficial as it brought practical knowledge that the participants needed to assemble and disassemble computers. Therefore, by walking through the formats systematically, the participants interactively acquired firsthand knowledge of the major elements and subcomponents, including the motherboard, CPU, RAM, GPU, and storage devices. Besides, this activity boosted their confidence when it comes to handling delicate hardware ; it also helped develop problem solving skills of routine problems arising in system assembly.

The help of the assistants was very helpful for the accomplishment of the activity. They were also able to provide clear explanation of the procedure to be followed, time and nicely encouraged participants to make the necessary changes safely. From this, it was clear that every member of the team had to be a good team player and pay attention to detail as well as be technically competent, which are some of the key expected values of IT and technology workers. Through the synergy between the concepts learned and the practical implementation of the concept embodied in the activity, participants had an assurance the next time they were faced with computational hardware, whether in academic projects, professional angles or person projects, they would handle it gracefully.
