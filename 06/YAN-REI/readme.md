|Assignment 1    |`'My first reflection duringthis PC assembly is that I have 
                  to listen to the instruction of lecturer carefully before 
                  disassemble the PC so that I will not damage it. My second 
                  reflection is that teamwork is important in this session.Each 
                  member memorise the location of different part of the PC, so 
                  that we can assemble the PC back on time.'`                  |
|Assignment 2    |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
