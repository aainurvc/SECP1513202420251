Assignment	Reflection
Assignment 1	I learned that I must listen to the instructions of lecturer during PC assembly and disassembly so that I will not damage the PC. Secondly, teamwork is important in this session. Each member memorized the location of the different components of the PC so that we could assemble back the PC successfully. For example, I memorized the location of CPU fan. Without teamwork we could not finish the assembly on time as one person is not able to memorize all the components and their location.
Assignment 2	The second assignment was about doing poster for industrial talk on technology career. The first reflection was that fairness in task division is crucial. During task division, we divided the task based on member's strength and made sure the task was not overloaded for each member. The second reflection I gained from the poster assignment about the industrial talk is the speaker's insight that cloud computing combined with cybersecurity offers great career prospects. This sparked my interest, and I now feel motivated to explore this direction further in my studies and future career.
Assignment 3	The third assignment was creating a video about our industrial visit to UTM DIGITAL. Each member recorded themselves answering a question from the task template, which helped me confidently express my opinions on camera. Time management was also important, as I had to submit my recording on time for the editor to combine all our recording.
