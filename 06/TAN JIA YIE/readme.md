|PC Assmble               |I appreciate this golden opportunity given by Dr. Iqbal to have hands-on practice assembling a PC. It deepened my understanding of hardware components and their functions, which are crucial even in my field of network security. This practical experience not only helped me perform better in the quiz but also bridged the gap between theoretical learning and real-world application. My teammates' cooperation made the task more efficient and enjoyable. This activity reinforced the importance of understanding hardware as a foundation for configuring secure and reliable networks. It also emphasized how teamwork and practical exposure are essential in mastering technical skills.|
