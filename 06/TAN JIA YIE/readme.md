|PC Assemble               |I appreciate this golden opportunity given by Dr. Iqbal to have hands-on practice assembling a PC. It deepened my understanding of hardware components and their functions, which are crucial even in my field of network security. This practical experience not only helped me perform better in the quiz but also bridged the gap between theoretical learning and real-world application. This activity reinforced the importance of understanding hardware as a foundation for configuring secure and reliable networks. |
|Assignment 1 (Industry Talk Poster)             |The industry talk by AirAsia provided a comprehensive overview of how ICT facilitates multi-national cooperation and seamless operations across different regions. Additionally, I was inspired by their unique "Allstar" approach, which promotes equal opportunities and same-level management. The organizational structure, supported by advanced ICT tools, bridging cultural and operational gaps across the company. I also realized that having fluent and excellent communication skills opens up more opportunities to express our thoughts confidently. |
|Assignment 2 (Industrial Visit Video)               |The industrial visit in this place UTM Digital was such an eye-opener. I gained a deeper understanding of the practical applications of network security, data management, and digital solutions. I am deeply grateful to all the staff at UTM Digital for providing exceptional service in managing and running the UTM system so efficiently. This visit also gives the importance of staying updated to the latest industry technologies and trends. Interacting with the friendly staff at UTM Digital gave me a clearer views on future opportunities and motivated me to align my academic learning with real-world practices.|
|Assignment 3 (Academic Writing)             |I realized the importance of combining theoretical knowledge with practical skills, such as effective communications that boost up productivity. Engaging in group projects has improved my ability to express ideas and foster teamwork. The IRPA method has helped me align my strengths with my career goals, guiding my educational decisions. Additionally, continuous learning is essential for staying updated with industry trends and remaining competitive era.|
|Assignment 4 (Poster on CODE'25)             |Attending this workshop brings me to unique experiences. I learned about powerful tools like Sherlock and BreachDirectory, which can address vulnerabilities and enhance security measures in ways I had never considered before. I left feeling inspired and motivated to explore OSINT further and integrate this knowledge into my studies. The insights gained have opened my eyes to new possibilities, and Iâ€™m excited to apply what Iâ€™ve learned through hands on pratices.|
|Design Thinking Project            |This final project has provided me with the opportunity to implement essential skills such as effective communication with interviewers and critical thinking to address current issues. Ultimately, we developed a remarkable idea, UTMGPT, which aims to streamline operations at the university and bring numerous benefits. We are excited to explore the implementation of this program in the near future. I sincerely thank Dr. Iqbal and my teammates for their efforts and cooperation throughout this project.|
