Hi! 


## Reflections on assessment done! ðŸ¥³

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|      Assessments          |Refelctions                                             |          
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|Assignment 1               |`'Isn't this fun?'`            |
|Assignment 2               |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |
|Assignment 3               |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|
