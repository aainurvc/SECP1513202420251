‚Ä¢ PC ASSEMBLE

I learned step-by-step on how to assemble and diassemble the PC. The PC assemble was a hands-on experience that helps me to understand more about computer hardware. It was my first time handling different components such as RAM, CPU, hard disk and power supply. The process was a bit difficult but it made our teamwork stronger when we can explain to each other, how the component works. This experience was valuable that will help students to get into real-world applications.



‚Ä¢ ASSIGNMENT 1 - POSTER ON INDUSTRY TALK (CLARITY TECHWORKS)

The Clarity Techworks employee's talk was a very eye-opening experience that helps me to gain knowledge on the IT industry. Each speakers explain their job scopes, skills needed and also give their advices. I also learned when the speakers encourage us to focus more on soft skills and communication as it is important for effective teamwork and navigate challenges.  Creating poster as a team was a great experience because we share our ideas and creativity.
