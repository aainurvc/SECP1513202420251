- PC ASSEMBLE

I learned step-by-step on how to assemble and diassemble the PC. The PC assemble was a hands-on experience that helps me to understand more about computer hardware. It was my first time handling different components such as RAM, CPU, hard disk and power supply. The process was a bit difficult but it made our teamwork stronger when we can explain to each other, how the component works. This experience was valuable that will help students to get into real-world applications.
