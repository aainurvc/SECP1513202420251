## 🎉 Welcome to *Ezra's Eportfolio* !!! 🎉  

#### Hey there! 👋 This is where I share my journey through *TIS* over the past few months. Each experience has been a mix of challenges, teamwork, and new discoveries. Scroll down and check out what I’ve learned along the way! 🚀✨  

| **Activity** | **Reflection** |  
|--------------|---------------|  
| **🛠️ PC Assembly** | Taking apart a PC and putting it back together felt like solving a high-stakes puzzle 🧩, but thanks to Dr. Iqbal’s guidance, we nailed it! Our team even finished the fastest ⏳💨. Besides getting hands-on with hardware, I realized just how crucial teamwork is when tackling technical challenges. |  
| **🎨 Assignment 1** | Before starting, we attended an industry talk by AirAsia ✈️, which gave me fresh insights into the field. My role? Designing and structuring the poster 🎭—a task that really tested my creativity. Seeing my teammates love the final product was the best reward! 🤩 |  
| **🎥 Assignment 2** | This assignment took us on an industry visit to UTM Digital 🏢, where we got to hear firsthand from professionals. Their stories were super inspiring and made me reflect on my own career path. Editing the video was a whole other challenge 🎬—from unclear subtitles to audio mishaps—but thanks to teamwork, we turned it around! 🔥 |  
| **📑 Assignment 3** | Another industry talk, another assignment! This time, it was all about academic writing ✍️. I learned the IRPA Method 📌, which is actually useful for job and business applications. The toughest part? Squeezing everything into a limited number of pages 📏, but we found ways to make it concise without losing important details. |  
| **🔍 Assignment 4** | No industry visit this time 😔, but we did attend a cybersecurity workshop at CODE’25 called *"OSINT-Beginner’s Guide."* 🕵️‍♂️ I walked away with a ton of knowledge on cybersecurity tools I never knew existed! My task was designing and organizing the poster 🎨, and with the team’s support, everything came together seamlessly. |  
| **💡 Design Thinking Project** | This was a long-term project with everything from brainstorming to prototyping and video creation 🎭📊. It was a huge reminder of how vital teamwork is in keeping everything running smoothly. It also made me realize how fast technology is evolving 🚀, turning creative ideas into reality faster than ever. |
