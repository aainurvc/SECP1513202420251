##  Welcome to *Ezra's Eportfolio* !!! 🎉  

#### Hey there! 👋 This is where I share my journey through *TIS* over the past few months. Each experience has been a mix of challenges, teamwork, and new discoveries. Scroll down and check out what I’ve learned along the way! ✨  

| **Activity** | **Reflection** |  
|--------------|---------------|  
| **PC Assembly** | Taking apart a PC and putting it back together felt like solving a difficult puzzle , but thanks to Dr. Iqbal’s guidance, we nailed it! Our team was one of the fastest, securing 3rd place .  I also realized that guys tend to know more about PCs than girls, and showed me the importance of learning these skills, regardless of background! |  
| **Assignment 1** | Before starting this assignment, we attended an industry talk by AirAsia, and honestly, I was blown away! Hearing about their growth, innovation, and work culture made me admire how they operate. I also got a clearer idea of what skills are needed to land an internship at a company like adaptability, problem-solving, and teamwork. It was an eye-opener and made me even more excited about the industry! |  
| **Assignment 2** |For this assignment, we visited UTM Digital, where I had the opportunity to interview professionals in the field. Listening to their personal experiences and career journeys was truly inspiring—it gave me a clearer picture of the industry and the different paths I could take. This experience made me realize the importance of networking and learning directly from those in the field. |  
| **Assignment 3** | Another industry talk, another assignment! This time, it was all about academic writing. I learned the IRPA Method , which is actually useful for job and business applications. |  
| **Assignment 4** | No industry visit this time, but we did attend a cybersecurity workshop at CODE’25 called *"OSINT-Beginner’s Guide."* 🕵️‍♂️ and it was definitely amazing! We weren’t just listening to speakers—we got hands-on experience with challenges that made learning even more engaging. Solving real-world cybersecurity problems felt like a game, and the speakers were super helpful in guiding us through it. It was an exciting and interactive way to explore a field I hadn’t dived into before!|  
| **Design Thinking Project** | This was a long-term project with everything from brainstorming to prototyping and video creation. I contributed by brainstorming and using my creativity to help develop the prototype. It was a great reminder of how teamwork enhances efficiency and how quickly technology turns ideas into reality! |
