After completing the WASHED project, I feel a strong sense of accomplishment and growth. Developing an IoT-based laundry system challenged me to think critically about real-world problems and apply technical skills to create a practical solution. The experience deepened my understanding of IoT technology, user-centered design, and the importance of addressing both customer and business needs.

Working on this project also highlighted the value of collaboration, research, and innovation. Analyzing competitors like De Dobi and dobiQueen helped me identify gaps in the market and refine our system to offer unique features, such as machine locking and preset modes. This project has not only enhanced my technical abilities but also strengthened my problem-solving and communication skills.

Moving forward, I am motivated to continue exploring how technology can simplify everyday tasks and improve efficiency in various industries. This project has reinforced my belief in the power of innovation to create meaningful, user-focused solutions.
