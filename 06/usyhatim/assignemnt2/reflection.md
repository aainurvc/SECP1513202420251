Our inaugural industry visit provided valuable insights into UTM Digital’s service operations and their role in supporting students and staff. We explored various digital offerings, including online platforms for lectures and grading, and observed how the team continuously improves services based on user feedback. Notably, we learned about innovative initiatives like blockchain-based certificates and financial systems, reflecting UTM’s commitment to technological advancement.

This visit enhanced our understanding of digital infrastructure, departmental collaboration, and long-term technological progress. Special thanks to Dr. Iqbal, UTM staff, and our team for making this experience enriching, especially through our collaborative video project.
