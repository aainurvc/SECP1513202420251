# Reflection on Industry Visit to UTM Digital
In our first industry visit of our semester to UTM Digital, I certainly got invaluable experiences and knowledge by visiting a real-world industry. First of all, I was exposed to the services provided by UTM Digital and how each department is responsible for different services. It was fascinating to see how these services support all UTM students and staffs, essentially keeping the entire university functioning. This is especially vital as most tools used in classes, lectures, and grading rely heavily on online platforms. I was also mesmerized by how all the staffs are tirelessly working to constantly improve their services based on the feedback and suggestions received. Interviewing the staffs in UTM Digital also gave us an insight on projects they are working on such as blockchain-based certificates and financial systems. The advanced discussion rooms further showcased how the industry is pushing boundaries to provide cutting-edge services for the UTM community. 

This visit has inspired me to appreciate the backbone of digital systems and the importance of adapting to feedback for constant improvement. I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Iqbal, the UTM staff, and everyone involved in organizing this visit. It was an enriching experience that provided us with both knowledge and inspiration.

As for the assignment, I was able to collaborate effectively with my group to produce a complete video, where we shared our thoughts on the visit, along with our experiences and opinions. This process not only strengthened our teamwork and communication skills but also allowed us to reflect deeply on what we learned during the visit.
