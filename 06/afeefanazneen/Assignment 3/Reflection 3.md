# Reflection on Academic Writing
I believe adaptability is important in the field of computer science because the technology is evolving,introducing new technologies. To stay relevant, I must be able to adapt to these technologies in the industry such as cloud computing, blockchain and artificial intelligence. I need to keep myself updated so that I can equip myself with the technical skills necessary to solve complex problems. For example, I should practice coding daily and attend tech events to enhance my problem-solving and analytical thinking skills. I also have to participate in activities that can help me improve my communication and management skills to work efficiently in groups and help the team overcome challenges. This means, therefore, that it is only through continuous learning and practicing the skills in computer science that I can make contributions to technology.

As for the assignment, I learned to prepare academic writing by synthesizing information from research papers and insights gained from a professional talk. This process helped me develop skills in analyzing credible sources, organizing key points effectively, and presenting them in a structured academic format.
