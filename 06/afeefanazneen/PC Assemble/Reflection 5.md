# Reflection on Personal Computer (PC) assemble
In this activity, I gained an understanding on how to assemble and reassemble a PC in the correct order and how to handle the components properly. We got to see, touch and learn each components of the PC such as the power supply, RAM, hard disk, motherboard and CPU fan. The competition to see who could assemble the PC was an interactive way to engage students and make the learning process fun. It was also a chance to collaborate and bond with the each other, especially since we were still new students of the semester. The quiz after the activity also deepen our understanding and allowed us to reflect on our experiences, helping us ingrain them in our memory, much like a PCs RAM.
