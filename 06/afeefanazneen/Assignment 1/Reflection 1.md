# Reflection on Industry talk EY Tech Consulting
In this Industry talk, I got to learn that the jobs in the technology sector for Computer Science students are not just limited to office roles like Software Engineer, Data Analyst or Network Engineer, instead EY company provides tech consulting as well as consulting in areas like business strategy for its clients. This made me realize how vast the job oppurtunities are and I don't necessarily have to stick to one job or one scope. As a Computer Science student, I can pivot into various related fields as long as I have the skills and knowledge needed. This talk allowed me to be open minded and explore the diverse career paths of Computer Science that aligns with my interest and capabilities. 
As for the assignment, the poster creation based on our talk allowed me to take away the key points from the talk, further enhancing my understanding. Additionally, it helped me adapt to effective communication with my group as we worked together to design the poster.
