# Reflection on Project Design Thinking
Throughout this project, I have gained valuable experience, from brainstorming ideas and discussing them with my groupmates to designing a prototype based on our proposal. In the initial phase, I had the opportunity to conduct thorough research on my niche topic, Augmented Reality (AR), and its applications in real-world scenarios. Many people associate AR primarily with gaming, but it extends far beyond that—being used in fields such as e-commerce, navigation, urban planning, and education. While AR is still evolving in various industries, it has proven to be a highly engaging and practical tool for users.
During our research, we recognized how traditional education still heavily relies on textbooks and exercises rather than interactive, hands-on learning. With AR integration, education is gradually adapting to modern advancements, making learning more immersive and engaging for students.
Moving into the planning phase, we discussed key features of our system, shared opinions, and refined our ideas through constructive feedback. This phase was particularly valuable as it allowed us to see our project from multiple perspectives, strengthening our concept.
In the final stage, designing the prototype, we put our creativity into action, turning our vision into a tangible system by incorporating the features we had developed. This experience provided me with insight into the three essential phases of developing a functional system that aligns with client needs.
One of the main challenges we faced was occasional miscommunication within the team, which made it difficult to align our ideas. Additionally, ensuring that our prototype was interactive and well-designed required a lot of effort and refinement. We overcame these obstacles by improving our communication, actively listening to each other’s ideas, and reaching a common understanding. Further research into existing AR systems also helped us refine our design and create a more effective solution.
I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Iqbal for this incredible opportunity, my client for their willingness to participate, and my team members for their dedication and collaboration in making this project a success.
