# Reflection on each assignments. :flying_saucer: :mantelpiece_clock:

| **Activity**                    | **Reflection**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Quiz: PC Assembly**           | The PC assembly activity was an incredible hands-on experience. I had the opportunity to disassemble and reassemble a PC while collaborating with my group members. Through the disassembly process, I gained a deeper understanding of the components and the steps required for assembly. Afterward, we participated in a mock quiz, which strengthened the knowledge I had just learned during the activity, helping me to better retain the concepts and procedures. |
| **Assignment 1: Poster**    [Assignment 1](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/blob/d0c3a0d418349deb1c04f0bede9892871929e5a4/03/phangsx25/Assignment%201.jpg)     | From this talk, I was introduced to EY and gained a better understanding of its operations. The speakers inspired me to continuously develop new skills and stay updated in this rapidly evolving field. I learned that adaptability and exploring various areas are crucial for achieving long-term career success.  |
| **Assignment 2: Video**     [Assignment 2](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/blob/ecea22db52b7952488314e29d5dc0c0f6b13c33d/03/phangsx25/Assignment%202.md)       | The industry visit to UTM Digital was an eye-opening experience. It provided insights into the internal systems supporting our university, such as the level-based approach to resolving reported issues. Additionally, I learned how to make full use of my UTM ID. Beyond accessing the student portal and UTM WiFi, I discovered the availability of free UTM-licensed software, which not only reduces costs but also provides essential academic tools to support my studies.  |
| **Assignment 3: Academic Writing**  [Assignment 3](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/blob/eb788e042fcad48082020ce71d3f3418184241a8/03/phangsx25/Assignment3%20.pdf) | This talk has given me a clearer direction for achieving success in this field. I will focus on mastering my fundamentals, solving problems, and applying knowledge everywhere I can. I will also join clubs and events that will help me learn from professionals, and build strong networks, improving both technical and interpersonal skills for this field.  |
| **Assignment 4: Poster**    [Assignment 4](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/blob/eb788e042fcad48082020ce71d3f3418184241a8/03/phangsx25/Assignment4.jpg)  | This workshop gave me a whole new perspective on bioinformatics. Before attending, I did not know much about it or how it actually worked. Ms. Sayang explained how biology and computer science come together in this field, which I found really interesting. As a fresh graduate and product data analyst, she shared her own experiences and explained how bioinformatics is used in different areas. She also talked about new trends and how they are changing biological research. This workshop helped me understand the potential of bioinformatics. |
| **Design Thinking Project: Proposal**  [Proposal](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/blob/eb788e042fcad48082020ce71d3f3418184241a8/03/phangsx25/Design%20Thinking%3AEYEDENTITY%20PROPOSAL.pdf) | During writing this proposal, I have explored the process of addressing real-world challenges while using innovative technology. It helped me to figure out the main issues with the current matric card. At the same time, I have an opportunity to propose a solution with vein biometrics. It was challenging and rewarding to me. This experience enhanced my ability to organize ideas clearly and practice my critical thinking about the usability and security of our product. It has been a valuable experience in my academic journey.  |
| **Design Thinking Project: Video**  [Video](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/blob/582b3cd83b83572451a5b15059216ca238a731ca/03/phangsx25/Design%20Thinking%20Video.md) | Making this video was a great experience for me and my team. In the video, we introduced a new system which is named "EYEDENTITY," our project that replaces matric cards with an iris scanning system. The video explained why we created it, the issue of losing or stealing matric cards, and showed how the system works, from registration to using it for secure access. Overall, it was a fun and valuable learning experience for me.
