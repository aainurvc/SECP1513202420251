# WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO ✌🏻

Hi, I'm Lim Zoey! 👋🏻

I’m currently a first- year student studying Computer Science in Network and Security at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). I’m particularly interested in pursuing a career in either cybersecurity or artificial intelligence, as I’m fascinated by the ways these fields shape our world and keep it secure. In the future, I desperate to create innovative solutions that enhance security or push the boundaries of AI. Outside of coding, I enjoy outdoor activities like diving and exploring emerging technologies.
