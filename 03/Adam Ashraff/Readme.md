# 👋 I'm Muhammad Adam Ashraff bin Zamri!

First-year **Data Engineering** student at **Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)**, passionate about data and programming. I can communicate in **Malay** and **English**, and while I'm still improving my fluency in **Arabic**, I can manage basic communication in all three languages. I'm excited to sharpen my skills to solve real-world challenges. Guided by the belief that **"Who has the data has the power"** – Tim O'Reilly, I am committed to learning, growing, and contributing to a data-driven future.

| 1   | Poster(Industry talk 1)             |      The talk from airasia was really captivating especially when they are sharing about their working experiences as software engineer in the big company.  I realized that skills needed not only technical abilities like programming, data management, and problem solving, but also soft skills like teamwork, adaptability, and effective communication. The assignmnet also shed light on the obstacles that software engineeer confront during work from home and the myths about WFH. Moreover, I discovered it exciting how these issues are being addressed through inventive thinking, continual learning, and cross-team collaboration. Lastly, airasia working culture ensure that everyone treated equally to make sure they not only enhance employee morale but also drive innovation and collective success.         |
