| 1            | Poster-Industry Talk 1 - Petronas Digital               | 22 NOV 2024  | From this talk, I can see that they are trying to go through their concept of oil and gas by holding a program called “Petronas Young Digital Programme” to find young fresh graduates that can share their creativity and make changes. This perspective emphasizes that, to be an effective data worker, conducting skill assessments is essential to understand our strengths and pinpoint areas for growth. Additionally, it highlights the importance of having a strong understanding of various data sources and collaborating with stakeholders to define clear and accurate data requirements. |
| 2            | Video-Industry Visit - UTM Digital                      | 10 DEC 2024  | In this industry talk, I believe we all have a better understanding of the knowledge required for each other's courses and the career direction after graduation. In addition, we also have a higher interest in computer technology, especially the camera that can automatically focus and zoom in on the person who is speaking. The organizers were very effective in allowing us to interact with each other at this event. This successfully allowed us to interact with our seniors and alumni and learn from their experiences. In our opinion, perhaps the organizers can increase the time for communication with alumni. This will allow us to understand the work that each department will face, which will allow us to have a better plan for employment after graduation. Finally, thank all the professors for their speeches and lectures. We learned a lot of knowledge outside of academics, which gave us a deeper understanding of technology UTM. |
| 3            | Poster-Industry Talk 2 - Skills in University and Industry| 20 JAN 2025  | I gained a lot from this speech, which made us no longer anxious about the future in the next four years of college. I deeply realized that we have to refine our choice and dig deep into our interest to reduce the risks of applying for the wrong job. Besides that, we can also start sending resumes to companies before graduation to increase our chances of being accepted and getting ahead of other competitors. The most important part is also to be fully prepared for the future of work. It is because we must showcase our ability through the project when entering the work. |
| 4            | Poster-Overview of CODE'25 Workshop                     | 11 JAN 2025  | After participating in Power BI Workshop for CODE'25, I found a great poster creation tool, which is Power BI Desktop. After the brief tutorial given by the instructor, I learned the basics of using this software. In summary, Power BI can record huge data in a table form. It can easily edit and filter information, then create a poster based on user needs. |
| 5            | Video-Design Thinking Project                           | 20 JAN 2025  | Our group created augmented reality (AR) glasses named Travelens using cardboard. Given the name, Travelens is the combination of 'travel' and 'lens'. After searching for information and comparing it with several similar products, our advantages are providing real-time navigation through a user interface for tourists to explore new destinations. Based on the practicality and safety of it, this type of AR glasses may lead GPS to a new level. |
