|--------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| **PC Assemble** |  22/10/2024 | ![PC Assemble](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/dc19beafc41e454ca88edf718f4232c1e783bcbd/03/kohziqian/PC%20Assemble.jpg) | I had learned the steps of assembling a PC and the importance of understanding hardware components. I think this is a fundamental skill for every computer science student because it provides insight into how hardware and software work together. |
| **Assg 1 Poster: Industry Talk - Petronas Digital** |  13/11/2024 | [Poster🔗](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/blob/dc19beafc41e454ca88edf718f4232c1e783bcbd/03/kohziqian/Assignment%201.pdf) | The industry talk provided valuable insights into the shift from traditional oil and gas operations to digital transformation. They also highlight the importance of ICT skills such as software engineering, data engineering, and data science. The "Petronas Young Digital Programme" demonstrates their efforts to engage young graduates in driving innovation and efficiency. This talk has inspired me to enhance my digital skills. |
| **Assg 2 Video: Industry Visit - UTMDigital** |  10/12/2024 |  | This industry visit to UTMDigital was an insightful experience that bridged the gap between theory and practice. It gave me a chance to explore how technologies are integrated into the university's operations and support daily tasks. The visit also offered a glimpse into the real-world challenges professionals face, providing me with a better understanding of how to apply my academic knowledge in the field.

| **Assg 3 Report: Industry Talk - Skills Needed in Industry and Computer Science Course** |  17/12/2024 | [Report🔗](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/blob/e72c51e49ae8016df3d07bc270897968f02e1c7f/03/kohziqian/Assignment%203.pdf) | The industry talk had provided valuable insights into the skills needed in the industry. The talk emphasized that while good grades are important, they are not the sole factor for success. Technical skills, such as programming, are essential, but equally important are non-technical skills like communication, collaboration, and teamwork. This experience made me realize that I need to focus not only on strengthening my technical abilities but also on developing my "soft skills" to work effectively in a professional environment. |

I learned how to design interactive dashboards, create detailed reports, and use various Power BI tools to present data in a more understandable way. The practical approach of the workshop allowed me to better understand how to communicate data-driven insights clearly. |
| **Design Thinking Project** |  24/1/2025 | [Video🔗](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BiIcbN03Fw) | This project has been an incredible learning journey that has greatly enhanced my problem-solving and communication skills.
