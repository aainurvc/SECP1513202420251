I’m currently a first-year student at **Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)**, studying for my Bachelor’s degree in **Computer Science**. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can bring ideas to life, and this passion led me to choose a specialization in **Graphics and Multimedia Software**.

In the future, I aspire to create innovative projects in fields like animation, game design, and immersive technologies such as VR and AR. I believe that every challenge is an opportunity to learn, and I’m looking forward to taking on new skills and technologies that will bring me closer to my dreams.
