### Lab 1: 🔧 PC Assembly Lab
#### 🔍 Overview
Our first hands-on lab gave us the opportunity to learn the inner workings of a desktop personal computer.

We were taught step-by-step, guided by the lab assistants on how to properly disassemble and reassemble a desktop tower. The lab assistants also explained on each component and its uses to the functionality of the computer. We also had a little fun competition and determine which group could re-assemble the PC back the quickest.

Finally, with all the information gathered, we were asked to answer a short quiz on the lab.

#### 📦**Deliverable(s)** 
- Quiz

#### 🧠 Reflection

> <b>This lab being my first lab and hands-on experience was exciting and nervous at the same time. For a device that I personally use daily, I had never thought about looking into the internals and exploring what goes into something I use so often.
>
><b> I felt that this lab had given me a great opportunity to explore the hardware side of IT and gave me confidence for me to explore my own desktop tower at home for purposes such as upgrading, learning or just tinkering and having fun in my own time.

#### 🧠 Reflection

><b>This assignment was my very first assignment with my group in this subject, it had allowed me to learn the fundamental elements of design through our poster design and how to deliver information in a concise and interactive way.
>
><b>Furthermore, I was able to get a glimpse into real-world industries, in our group's case, the aviation industry's culture and how they operate. I also learned about how to go about Work From Home properly and learn more on AirAsia's internship programme. Additionally, I had also learnt on the importance of maintaining a good healthy mindset in a work environment.
>
><b>Finally, I also had a chance to get to know my groupmates and understand them better. As it was the first assignment, we had slight friction in communication as we did not know each other well yet. However, we swiftly resolved this issue through effective communication with each other and respecting each other.

#### 🧠 Reflection

><b>The second assignment was my very first industrial visit, which was very exciting. It gave me a chance to exit the four walls of the classroom and visit real-world office space in the IT world. The excitement was further amplified due to the destination - UTMDigital.
>
><b> I had an opportunity to peek behind the curtains of UTMDigital, the provider of pivotal infrastructure ensuring UTM's smooth daily operations! For example, the ever-crucial UTMWiFi and its infrastructure including access points, ethernet points and coverage as well as bandwidth. I also had a chance to hear a brief talk on Data Engineering by UTMDigital's own staff which shed light on UTM's management of an incredulously large volume of data the university handles.
> 
> <b>Moreover, since the task involved video creation, I got to master the fundamentals of video editing and adding effects, music and more to improve the video's entertainment value.
>
> <b>Finally, since this visit was a physical acitivity, I got to finally meet my group members and have fun together recording various clips and taking notes for what would be our submission of the video assignment. It had brought us closer as groupmates and friends, and communication was much more smoother compared to Assignment 1.

### Assignment 3: 📝 [Report on an Industrial Talk, "Skills in University and Industry" ](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/blob/main/03/TylerChok/Assignment%203%20-%20Skills%20in%20University%20and%20Industry.pdf)
#### 🔍 Overview

Assignment 3 tasked us on creating an Academic Writing Report on an Industrial Talk we attended hosted by UTM. The talk features two speakers: 
- Mr. Nik Mohd Habibullah (CEO of Micro Semiconductor Sdn. Bhd.) 
- Mr. Mohd Hakimi Iqmall (Information Technology Officer at UTMDigital)

The talk touched on various topics including the skills that computer science, university and industry requires as well as a little on Mr. Nik Mohd Habibullah's projects and ventures such as GetMeHired and Dialysis Manager, to name a few. Mr. Mohd Hakimi Iqmall also laid out his numerous projects in UTMDigital including RAIDS 4.0, Payroll 2.0 and more.

Finally, we had to create an Academic Writing Report by consolidating all the information we gathered from the talk as well as citate two academic writing papers:

- [Knowledge and Skill Requirements for Entry-Level Information Technology Workers: A Comparison of Industry and Academia](https://jise.org/volume20/n3/JISEv20n3p349.pdf)
- [Information and communication technology workforce employability in Malaysia](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/10650741211212340/full/html)

#### 📦**Deliverable(s)**

#### 🧠 Reflection
><b>In this third assignment, my groupmates and I attended an industrial talk which allowed us to gain insights from the speakers invited.
>
> <b>This assignment had gave me more information on what the industry actually needs in terms of skills other than good grades. For example, how we need to hone our skills in technical skills such as programming, as well as non-technical skills such as our "people skills", interacting, collaborating and working together harmoniously.
> 
> <b> This talk allowed me to understand what skills I have to place emphasis on and what other skills I may require outside the scope of IT to prepare myself to start my internship and eventually, my career.
> 
><b>For our group, this assignment presented quite a challenge as we had a limit of fitting a lot of content into three pages. Our group had to gather to discuss on what is appropriate to cut or paraphrase and shorten as well as using other techniques to achieve the requirements of this assignment.

#### 🧠 Reflection
> <b>Assignment 4 had managed to expose me to the PowerBI application by Microsoft which is essentially a data visualiser.
> 
> <b> Through this workshop, I have learnt that the data visualisation is an important tool to allow for decision-making, especially in the corporate world or any other fields which handle big data.
> 
> <b> This assignment was similar to the first assignment in terms of deliverables where we had to make a poster. Since my group and I had already done 3 assignments together, and one poster already, we were confident we could make another good submission.

## <img src="https://gdurl.com/gQ3X" width="40" align='left'/>Design Thinking Project

### 📱 [InfinitePROTECH Application](https://youtu.be/-n2pWXk1pg4)
#### 🔍 Overview
The Design Thinking Project is a project which focuses on the design thinking problem-solving approach. Design thinking has five processes: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.

We were tasked to integrate the design thinking process into our project with a main theme. For my group and I, our theme was **Cybersecurity**.

Thus, with our theme, we had to identify existing issues, engineer a solution towards said issues, create a prototype of said solution and finally demonstrate and present our idea.

My group and I finalised on creating an application, **InfinitePROTECH** which aims to protect users from scams.<sub> [Learn More](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202420251/tree/main/03/TylerChok/Design%20Thinking%20Project) <sub>

<br>

#### 🧠 Reflection
><b> The Design Thinking Project was a very big task for my group and I as it involved many processes and, eventually coming up which a physical low-fidelity prototype.
>
> <b> My group and I decided to create an application called InfinitePROTECH. However, we faced many challenges such as coordinating the time to discuss and build the prototype as we had differing schedules. Also, we initially had difficulty in thinking of a viable solution to the problems identified. Additionally, we also face difficulty in finding a proper recording venue and assembling the final prototype.
> 
> <b> However, in the face of adversity, our group did not fumble and only grew stronger from it. Coordinating and compromising with each other to set up a proper time and date to meet up and complete the task. We also each pitched ideas to each other to help decide on the best solution and finally, some of our group members found a suitable recording space for our presentation.
> 
><b> This project, I felt was the most impactful to me as it had taught me that with teamwork, great things can be achieved. My friends and I got together and had a lot of fun designing our presentation materials, low-fidelity prototype and more. Our little arguments about little imperfections or issues did not split the group but only strengthened it as we all wanted to do our best for this project, and I belive, we did achieve our best.
