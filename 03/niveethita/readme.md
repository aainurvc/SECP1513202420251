| 1    | **Assignment 1**  <br> Task : Poster on Industry Talk 1 <br> Title : Overview of ICT Jobs in Industry <br>     | 23/11/24   | The Industry Talk by AirAsia inspired me to explore opportunities with them. I was particularly drawn to their "All-Stars" culture which embraces inclusivity in the workplace where every employee is equally respected and appreciated. They also exposed us to their diverse range of products and services beyond aviation service, which I found impressive. Plus, the WFH tips they shared were useful for me to apply it as a student. |
| 2    | **Assignment 2**  <br> Task : Video on Industry Visit 1 <br> Title : Visit To UTMDigital  <br>   | 10/12/24   | The industrial visit to UTMDigital was a great experience as we got to explore the Digital Care Offices, meeting rooms, and advanced technologies like the Smartboard. We also gained valuable insights into UTMDigital‚Äôs services and received an in-depth explanation of Data Engineering. |
| 3    | **Assignment 3**  <br> Task : Academic Talk on Industry Visit 2 <br> Title : Skills in University and Industry  <br>    | 17/12/24   | I am inspired by the valuable insights and essential information on building a career in computer science from the talk. I also found it fascinating to learn about two different career paths within the same field. This experience inspired me to enhance my technical skills by engaging in self-directed learning beyond the classroom and participating in university activities to develop my soft skills. |
| 4    | **Assignment 4**  <br> Task : Poster on  COMPUTING OPEN DAY & EXHIBITION 2025 <br> Title : Overview of CODE'25 Workshop  <br>    | 11/01/25  | I find this Power BI Workshop to be useful for me as i gain basic skills to use Microsoft Power BI which is useful for data visualisation.I believe these skills will be useful for me in the near future as it touches on data cleaning, DAX expression application and visualisation for data analysis purpose. |
